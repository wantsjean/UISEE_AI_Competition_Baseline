# UISEE_AI_Competition_Baseline
 A simple baseline of UISEE Self-Driving Competition.

# TODO List
- [x] Add submit testing. training and submit by excute 'python submit.py'
- [x] Build a faster dataset, save images to `npy` files.
- [ ] Add more data augmentation, random resize, crop, rotate, ...
- [ ] Add pretraining datasets.

# Getting Start
1. Git clone this repo.
1. Download the competition dataset from uisee.com & unzip it under `data` folder and rename it to `uisee`(for more datasets supporting)
1. Use `tiff2npy` to convert and resize `tiff` images to `npy` files
1. Baseline model is a simple 2D CNN + LSTM model, DIY your own model and adjust the Hyper Parameters in the `config.py` file, then start training.
1. `this_repo/submit.txt` will be generated by excuting `submit.py`.
